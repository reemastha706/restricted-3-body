# restricted-3-body
This is a small project that I did in my undergraduate.
It is a simulation for a spacecraft launched from the EARTH to the MOON and making a trajectory because of the influence of the huge bodies around in space. 
The detail of the project can be found in the report file uploaded in this folder. 
Here is the python based code for the program. 
1. Run the code.
2. A x-y coordinate plot will appear, and after cancelling the plot window, the simulation will be opened in the local host of the browser.
3. Press **Run** to start the simulation and **Pause** to pause it. 
4. You can try to change the paramters to play with the simulation. 

**If you don't have Vpython installed, then it is necessary to pre-install it**
